# Introduction

Hello, I'm Plawan Ghimire, and I'm an aspiring entrepreneur with a strong background in financial accounting, reporting, and auditing. Currently pursuing my ACCA Skills Level certification, I have demonstrated expertise in audit and assurance, financial reporting, financial management and performance management. My educational journey includes a Diploma in Accounting and Business from ACCA, and successful completion of high school and secondary school with commendable academic achievements.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have developed robust technical skills in MS Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, along with a leadership background as the School Captain and Head Boy at Radhika Secondary School. My passion for financial modeling and reporting led me to contemplate the establishment of an outsourcing firm, specializing in serving venture-backed startups and medium-sized companies in the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications (TMT) industries.

I envision creating a niche by focusing on financial reporting for TMT startups, offering services such as bookkeeping, payroll, and annual statutory financial reporting. What sets my firm apart is the meticulous approval process, with all reports verified by an IFAC certified accountant, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

This venture aims to not only be a leading outsourcing provider but also harbors the ambitious goal of bringing one of the Big4 companies to Nepal. Through this journey, I seek to establish lasting partnerships with growing startups, providing tailored packages and continuously improving service quality based on valuable client feedback.

As I embark on this entrepreneurial journey, I am committed to addressing potential challenges such as client acquisition, market competition, scalability, regulatory compliance, and client retention. Through strategic solutions and a dedication to excellence, my aim is to position the outsourcing firm as a prominent player in the TMT industries.

Feel free to connect with me as I embark on this exciting venture, combining financial expertise with a passion for fostering long-term business success.
