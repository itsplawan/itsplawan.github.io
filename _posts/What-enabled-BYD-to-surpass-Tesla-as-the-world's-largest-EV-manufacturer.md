BYD has overtaken Tesla in global EV sales in Q4 of 2023. Let’s take a plunge on how much this is thanks to the Chinese EV subsidy policies and what allowed BYD to achieve this.


Tax Exemptions from the Chinese Government
------
China has unveiled $72.3 billion (520 billion Yuan) tax breaks for electric vehicles over the coming four years to boost sales growth.
New EVs purchased in 2024 and 2025 will have up to 30,000 yuan per vehicle and will be slashed to half for the remainder of the four years.
This exemption comes as the continuation of subsidy provided by the Chinese government for more than a decade.


Sales Price and Affordability
------
A customer has the option to choose from ten models from BYD under $30,000 as opposed to the cheapest offer from Tesla which costs $38,990 for the base Tesla Model 3. This gives customers in BYD’s existing international markets like Brazil, Thailand, India, and Nepal options and easier access to EVs at a lower cost.
Also, as opposed to the business strategy of Tesla, BYD started with cheap electric taxis and buses that allowed them to perfect their batteries and then they have been gradually moving towards producing more expensive cars in recent days.
The average price paid for a Tesla is $45,000 while the BYD sells for roughly half of that at $22,400.
They also use Lithium-Ion Phosphate (Li-Po) batteries in their cars which are cheaper and can be packed more compactly in battery packs.


Vertical Integration in the Production Process
------
This is a fancy way of saying that BYD makes a lot of its components in-house. They are the only EV makers that produce their batteries in-house.
Car manufacturers often buy parts from Bosch, Continental, and Aptiv while BYD tries their best not to. An example of the same is the Volkswagen-manufactured ID3 car has only 35% of its in-house products, Tesla’s Model 3 has 68% of its in-house products while BYD Seal has 75% of its components made in-house.
This lower level of interdependence on external suppliers provides BYD with greater flexibility to react to market changes.


Covid-19 Pandemic and BYD
------
The vertical integration BYD focuses on so much paid its dividends in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It allowed them to control their business trajectories at a time when every other company was suffering because of the supply chain being in shambles.


Early Days and Financial Backing
------
Backed by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, BYD now outsells Volkswagen branded cars to become the nation's and the world’s largest EV manufacturer outselling Tesla-manufactured cars. Buffet got into BYD as one of the largest and earliest investors through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway. BYD has arguably the better moat among EV producers in current days being in the battery production business since 1995 and entering the EV market in 2003.


BYD Expansion and EU's Investigation
------
BYD is ramping up EV and battery production, with more China plants coming along the line. It's already building an EV factory in Thailand, set to begin production in mid-2024. BYD has announced it will build an EV plant in Brazil.
BYD's upscale Denza brand has expanded from the D9 minivan in late 2022 to the N7 crossover and N8 SUV.
BYD is expanding massively overseas. Thailand has become a big market, but it has entered many Asian countries, including Japan, India, Malaysia, Australia, Singapore and more. It's the No. 1 EV seller in Israel and has entered most of Europe. BYD also has started deliveries in Mexico, as part of a big push throughout Latin America.
Even though BYD has entered most of Europe, it is being investigated by the European Union in an “anti-subsidy probe in Chinese EVs” investigation. This investigation covers battery-powered cars produced in China, so it also includes non-Chinese companies like Tesla, Renault, and BMW. Also, this is unusual in ways because this was brought up by the European Commission themselves, rather than an industry complaint.
Apart from buses and trucks, the company has still not been able to enter the US with its cars because of the tensions between Beijing and Washington.


Conclusion
------
In the past industry experts expected old, more established auto manufacturers like General Motors, Volkswagen, and Toyota to catch up with Tesla in the EV space but in hindsight, it is no surprise to anyone that a Chinese rival got there first.
