**About Me**
---
I am an ACCA student currently pursuing Advanced Audit and Assurance awaiting results for Strategic Business Reporting for June 2024 session after having completed all modules of ACCA Skills Level. <br>
I have a deep understanding of International Financial Reporting Standards and Auditing Practices. The skill level's modules and Strategic Business Reporting module has made me equipped with a wide expanse of knowledge from Financial Reporting to Financial Management and Auditing. <br> <br>
I don't only have interests on accounting side of businesses but also have a great deal of interest on how the businesses undertake other areas, technology and personnel management.

**My Background**
---
I have been always been fascianted by numbers and the story they tell. I have always loved to look into sets of numbers and identify a pattern in them and use them to create meaningful stories they were trying to tell to others. Maybe this is what got me into accounting. <br>
<br>
Not only the numbers but computers and the vast world of internet, mainly website creation and hosting have always been something I always had a soft spot in my heart for. I have a Google Blogger website which has been up and running since July of 2017 which is still accessible.<br>

**Why this website?**
---
As I already mentioned how much I love creating and keeping a functional website, I was chuffed to bits when I learnt that I can host a personal-professional blog on Github with my own custom domain. So, I had to create one and keep this one updated for as long as I can.<br>
<br>
This website will work as a place where I write long form posts which LinkedIn will prevent me from writing. It will act as a collection of all if not most of the LinkedIn posts so I don't end up writing a book which actually should have just been a blog or few LinkedIn posts.<br>
